DynamoDB DAX Demo Notes
-----------------------------------------------------
Explain what is going on

1) We havea a DynamoDB table with orders between 1000000 and 1551001

When we run thae application, we choose randomly one order, and we retrieve it 1000 times.
First we use the code to use dynamodDB. It will retrieve it and show some statistics.
Then we use the exact same code, but with a dax cluster instead.

Explain that we will look at the first few characters of the customer ID and do a scan.
When we run it, the first run will be slow, but then it will be super fast after.

Compare results
Plain Get - about 1/4 to 1/5 the time
Scan - like 1/30th the time
